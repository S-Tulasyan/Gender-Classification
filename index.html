					Voice classification goes beyond just the frequency of the voice and thus requires additional feature detection and learning based on these features. We used five different models to get the initial accuracies and then used some ensemble methods such as bagging and feature extraction techniques such as PCA to improve the accuracies.

					<!-- Start edit here  -->
					Human ear has an excellent mechanism of perceiving the voice. It distinguishes the voice based on factors such as the loudness, frequency, the pitch and the resonating frequency. we will be distinguishing the human voice based on the genders - male or female. We will also be analyzing the be model that distinguishes the voices based on the training models.

						A human ear can distinguish between a male and female voice easily. If we want to teach a machine to do the same then what features of a voice would the machine require to classify ?

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						In order to analyze gender by voice and speech, a training database was required. A database was built using thousands of samples of male and female voices, each labeled by their gender of male or female. Voice samples were collected from the following resources:
						1) VoxForge Speech Corpus
						2) Kaggle

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						Five different models were trained to classify a voice sample as male or female. Two different techniques were proposed to reduce the dimensionality of data and voting among all the models was proposed to counter variance. The experimentation on the dataset shows an increase in accuracy for all the proposed methods. Random forest performed best in both the approaches involving dimensionality reduction. Voting among all the models seems to always increase the accuracy which is expected due to reduction in variance.
